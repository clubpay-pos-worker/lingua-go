// By default, Lingua uses lazy-loading to load only those language models on
// demand which are considered relevant by the rule-based filter engine. For web
// services, for instance, it is rather beneficial to preload all language models
// into memory to avoid unexpected latency while waiting for the service response.
// If you want to enable the eager-loading mode, you can do it as seen below.
// Multiple instances of LanguageDetector share the same language models in
// memory which are accessed asynchronously by the instances.
